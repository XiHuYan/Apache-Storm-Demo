# Apache-Storm-Demo
It was finished in the internship at Changsha branch of China telecom.

This is a simple demo of apache storm. Before execution, please make sure you have installed apache-storm, zookeeper, Squid. 
It will output multiple fields of access.log at the console.

Storm-KafkaSpout is similiar.
